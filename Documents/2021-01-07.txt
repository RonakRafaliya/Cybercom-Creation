----------- git & github -------------

1. difference between $git revert and $git reset.
	:- both are used to undo changes earlier commit command in your repository.
	:- when you use revert command the changes in between two commits undone, then new commit created which contain code in your repoafter the changes have been undone.
		it wil not changes the previous history of your poject.so developer can manage the accurate records of all the changes made in project.
	:- when you use reset commnad that removes all the commits from your repo and it will give the reverts repo back.

2. use revert keyword very different different level. and try so many times.

3. how sjow command use and how we can fetch our history in git bash
 
 *following is little bit explaination about how it work.*
